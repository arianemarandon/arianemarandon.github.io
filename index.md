I am a postdoc research associate at the Turing Institute, working as part of the [Turing-Roche partnership](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership) on developing new statistical methods within conformal prediction that can be levelled for healthcare applications.
Previously, I obtained my PhD from the [Laboratory of Statistics, Probability and Modélisation (LPSM)](https://www.lpsm.paris/index) @ Sorbonne Université, under the supervision of [Etienne Roquain](https://etienneroquain-81.webself.net/), [Tabea Rebafka](https://www.lpsm.paris/pageperso/rebafka/) and [Nataliya Sokolovska](https://sites.google.com/view/nsokolovska/home); focusing on controlling prediction error in various ML tasks, using tools from multiple testing.
